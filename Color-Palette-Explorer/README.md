## Reflection

It took me approximately four days to complete this project. Crafting the HTML and CSS files was relatively straightforward, but I encountered challenges when writing the JavaScript code. Developing this app provided me with valuable insights into color theory and manipulation.

Through this project, I deepened my understanding of how colors work and their significance in design. I learned various techniques for selecting and manipulating colors programmatically, which enhanced my skill set as a developer.

I was thinking how to share colors with other users and came up with an idea
that users may get copy of names and colors of palettes and send it.

Overall, despite the initial challenges, this project was a rewarding learning experience that allowed me to expand my knowledge and skills in web development.
